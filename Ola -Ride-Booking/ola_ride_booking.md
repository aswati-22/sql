Ola Ride Data Analysis using SQL

# About the Project 
This project focuses on analyzing Ola ride data using SQL. It includes data cleaning, business insights, and performance metrics. The goal is to identify patterns in customer behavior, ride frequency, revenue generation, and driver performance.

# Tools & Technologies Used
SQL ( PostgreSQL )

Excel (for initial data exploration)

GitHub (for version control and sharing)

# Key Analysis Performed
Total rides and revenue generated

Most frequent customers

City-wise ride analysis

Ride cancellation and delay trends

Driver performance & earnings

Peak hours and high-demand zones

# Dataset
Sample data is created/dummy data inspired by real-world Ola ride patterns.

Columns: Ride ID, Customer ID, Driver ID, Date, Time, Pickup & Drop Location, Fare, Tip, Distance, Status (Completed/Cancelled)

# Insights
Top 5 cities contribute to 60% of revenue.

20% drivers complete 80% of rides (Pareto analysis).

Evening hours (6â€“9 PM) show the highest demand.

High ride cancellations occur during peak traffic hours.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to derive meaningful insights from transportation data and support business decisions for a platform like Ola.
